  A <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_painting" target="_blank" title="DMP specification">matte painting (DMP)</strong></a> is a painted representation of <u>a landscape, set, or distant location</u> that allows filmmakers to create the illusion of an environment that is not present at the filming location.

  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">Historically, matte painters and film technicians have used various techniques to combine a matte-painted image with live-action footage. At its best, depending on the skill levels of the artists and technicians, the effect is "seamless" and creates environments that would otherwise be impossible or expensive to film. In the scenes the painting part is static and movements are integrated on it.</p>
